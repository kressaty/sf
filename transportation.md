# Transportation

Summary: buy a Clipper card, take Bart and Muni. If you cab, use Uber and Lyft. Skip the cable car.

## Clipper
All public transportation in the Bay Area takes Clipper. Go to Walgreens, buy one for $3, put $20 in credit on it. You'll save hundreds on cabs and rental cars.

## Bart
Bay Area Rapid Transit is the fast subway throughout the city; it travels all over the east bay as well. Use it to quickly move from SFO or Oakland airports into San Francisco, and between Soma/Downtown and the Mission.

## Muni
Muni can refer to a bus or a train. Use the trains to quickly move around the city, and to get to the Castro, Noe Valley, and the south side of the city. Uses busses for everything else.

## Cars - Driving, Renting, and Cabs
If you're going to drive, you'll pay to park. $15-$40 a day downtown, $10-$18 a day at meters. All meters accept Pay By Phone, so get the app on your phone.
If you're going to rent, signup for Zipcar before you come (takes a few days to get your membership card).

Cabs are more expensive than Uber or Lyft, so use the latter two. Uber will give you your first ride free if you [sign up here](https://www.uber.com/invite/v94nm).
