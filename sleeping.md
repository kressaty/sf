# Accomodations, Hotels, and Sleeping

Summary: AirBnB is fantastic. Hotels are expensive. Hostels are an option but AirBnB is probably better. The cheap places in the Tenderloin are cheap for a reason.

# AirBnB
AirBnB lets your rent someone else's place at a price they set. Use [my referral link](www.airbnb.com/c/nuser8703?s=8) and get $25 in credit.

# Hotels
If you want to splurge, the St. Regis, The Fairmont, and Four Seasons are great. I love the Clift, and there are all the usuals (W, Sheraton, Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott, etc). Be warned - hotels are expensive, especially during conference season.
