#Food, Eating, Restaurants, etc.

San Francisco could be the best food city in the US. New York definitely wins on the high end, and LA definitely wins on the low end, but San Francisco has a fantastic mix of incredible food from hole-in-the-wall ramen shops to Michelin-starred fine dining. Since telling "the best" is pretty much impossible, here's a list of some personal favorites along with how to determine where to eat next.

## About Yelp
Yelp is incredibly useful in SF. The sheer number of reviews should make this obvious. Whereas in many cities a 3-star Yelp review means it's a perfectly acceptable, and probably quite good, restaurant, here that's the mark of waning quality. Aim for 4 stars with hundreds of reviews. Make sure you're filtering by "open now" and the dollar signs you can afford - if it's a $$$ in your city, it's only a $$ here. If it's a $$$$ here, it's more expensive than anywhere in your city (unless you're in NY/LA). 

## Favorite Spots

#### Gary Danko
It's expensive, but incredible. Get a reservation, or go sit at the bar at 5pm.

#### State Bird Provisions
Not super expensive, impossible to get in to. Get in line. Some of the best food in the city.

#### SOMA Streat Food Park
Bunch of food trucks, most of which are fantastic. Bring cash.
